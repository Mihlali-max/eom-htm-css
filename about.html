                    Having started out his IT career getting his hands dirty in the technical trenches for many years , he has a fantastic understanding of both the business aspect of a company and what goes on in the technical background to keep the proverbial cogs turning. He is happiest when involved in client relations, managing business partners and exploring new technologies and revenue streams. Dax has a very positive energy and can’t do simply doesn’t exist in his vocabulary.

                  <h2>Yolanda Putuma</h2>
                  <p class="title">Technical Director</p>
                  <p style ="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">At the heart of every business there is at least one cool, calm collected and extremely clever guy. Julian is not only our financial brain, but he’s got a rare ability to problem solve pretty much anything that is out there.

                    He is a co-founder of Leftclick after he set up a successful business in the hosting sector shortly after his degree.
                    
                    He contributes vastly to the core of the business on all levels and ensures Leftclick is growing slowly but surely into one mean machine.
                    
                    Julian is also extremely technical with extensive experience on server infrastructures and WAN networks, but his primary focus is Leftclick’s general business model.
                    
                    And when life gets a little too exciting for him and relaxation is needed, he calms himself by getting involved in the antiques trade (they just don’t make stuff like they used to).
